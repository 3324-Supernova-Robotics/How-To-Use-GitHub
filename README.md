# How to Use GitHub

Hello Supernovas!  This is a quick tutorial on how to use GitHub.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (Jess).

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a platform used for version control.  You can see every change made to your code, and revert back to old versions if something new doesn't work.  GitHub allows your entire team to view, edit, and update the code, and everyone will be able to use these new changes.  

In VRC, when we generally have one or two programmers, GitHub's best use is:
- a backup when something happens to your computer
- allowing the builders on your team to change things, such as tuning an autonomous mode, changing a port, or tuning a preset position. 

## Getting Started

1) Make an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
2) Tell a coach or mentor your username and they will add you to the 3324 Supernova Robotics organization. 
3) Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Sign into your account through Github Deksotp.

## Getting Code onto Your Computer
Go to `File` -> `Clone Repository` then select your team number (eg. 3324Q).  Make sure the `Local Path` is in a place you will remember, I always put code in my `Documents` folder.  After you've done this, select `Clone`.  

This new folder is where all of your code will go.
