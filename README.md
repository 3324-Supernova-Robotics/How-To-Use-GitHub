# How to Use GitHub

Hello Supernovas!  This is a quick tutorial on how to use GitHub.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (Jess).

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a platform used for version control.  You can see every change made to your code, and revert back to old versions if something new doesn't work.  GitHub allows your entire team to view, edit, and update the code, and everyone will be able to use these new changes.  

In VRC, when we generally have one or two programmers, GitHub's best use is:
- a backup when something happens to your computer
- allowing the builders on your team to change things, such as tuning an autonomous mode, changing a port, or tuning a preset position. 

# Getting Started

1) Make an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
2) Tell a coach or mentor your username and they will add you to the 3324 Supernova Robotics organization. 
3) Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Sign into your account through Github Deksotp.

## Getting Code onto Your Computer
In GitHub Desktop, go to `File` -> `Clone Repository` then select your team number (eg. 3324Q).  Make sure the `Local Path` is in a place you will remember, I always put code in my `Documents` folder.  After you've done this, select `Clone`.  

Check the directroy and make sure you see your `3324Q` equivalent folder.  This is where all of your code will go.  

## Place Your Code

Within your `3324Q` equivalent folder, you will create your VEXcode or PROS projects.  

Please be sure to put multiple folders here!  This is useful for when you inevitably want to redo the code, or start a new robot that needs new code.

Note*  if you already have a GitHub repo for your team, transfer ownership to this organization.  

# Uploading to GitHub
This is a five step process that you should be doing after every successful thing you get working, and at the end of every practice.  GitHub is only useful if you're using it. 

## Step 1: Open GitHub Desktop

## Step 2: Go to the Correct Repository
Select `Current Repository` in the top left and make sure it says your `3324Q` equivalent.

### Step 3: Check Your Changes
Quickly look over what you've modified and make sure it is correct.  Everything in `red` has been removed, and everything in `green` has been added, make sure it looks correct.

## Step 4: Type a Commit Message and Description 
In the bottom left, write a short description of what you changed.

## Step 4: Commit Your Changes
Press `Commit to main`.

## Step 5: Push origin
The code will not show to GitHub until you push to origin.  To do this, in the top center of your screen, press `Push to origin`.
